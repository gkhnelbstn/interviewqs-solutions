# üß† InterviewQs Daily Challenge Solutions

Welcome to my InterviewQs challenges data science repository! This repository is created to help you solving problems in InterviewQs' daily challenges, in a well-structured and organized project setup.

## üåü Project Overview

Project Overview
This project focuses on tackling InterviewQs' daily coding challenges. We'll be working with various datasets related to these challenges and aiming to develop solutions that effectively address the problems presented.

## üîß Requirements

To use this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: 2.7 or 3.5+
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, itertools
